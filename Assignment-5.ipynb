    "1. Built a NER classifier following the tutorial.\n",

    "* Written assignments should be written in the given notebook cells. Please write them direcly in to the designated cells, and upload the notebook file to Wattle page.\n",
    "* Write answers in this notebook file, and upload the file to Wattle submission site. **Please rename and submit jupyter notebook file (Assignment5.ipynb) to your_uid.ipynb (e.g. u6000001.ipynb) with your written answers therein**.
